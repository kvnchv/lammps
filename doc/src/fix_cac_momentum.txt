fix cac/momentum command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID momentum N keyword values ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
cac/momentum = style name of this fix command :l
N = adjust the momentum every this many timesteps
one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {linear} or {angular} :l
  {linear} values = xflag yflag zflag
    xflag,yflag,zflag = 0/1 to exclude/include each dimension
  {angular} values = none :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all cac/momentum 1 linear 1 1 0
fix 1 boundary cac/momentum 100 linear 1 0 1
fix 1 all cac/momentum 100 linear 1 1 1 angular :pre

[Description:]

Zero the linear and/or angular momentum of the group of atoms and CAC
elements every N timesteps by adjusting their velocities.  One (or both) of
the {linear} or {angular} keywords must be specified.

If the {linear} keyword is used, the linear momentum is zeroed by
subtracting the center-of-mass velocity of the group. One
or more dimensions can be excluded from this operation by setting the
corresponding flag to 0.

If the {angular} keyword is used, the angular momentum is zeroed by
subtracting a rotational component from the group.

This command can be used to insure the entire collection of atoms and CAC
elements (or a subset of them) does not drift or rotate during the simulation
due to random perturbations (e.g. "fix langevin"_fix_langevin.html
thermostatting).

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various "output commands"_Howto_output.html.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.
