fix cac/oneway command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID cac/oneway N region-ID direction :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
oneway = style name of this fix command :l
N = apply this fix every this many timesteps :l
region-ID = ID of region where fix is active :l
direction = {x} or {-x} or {y} or {-y} or {z} or {-z} = coordinate and direction of the oneway constraint :l
:ule

[Examples:]

fix ions cac/oneway 10 semi -x
fix all cac/oneway 1 left -z
fix all cac/oneway 1 right z :pre

[Description:]

Enforce that particles and elements in the group and in a given region can only
move in one direction.  This is done by reversing respective
velocity components, if they have the wrong sign in the specified
dimension.  The effect is that the particle or element moves in one direction
only. It cannot be used to influence individual element nodes at this time;
in other words, if an element centroid is within the specified group and region,
all the nodal velocities will be subject to the oneway conditions.

This can be used, for example, as a simple model of a semi-permeable
membrane, or as an implementation of Maxwell's demon.
