compute cac/ke command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID temp :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
cac/ke = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all cac/ke
compute myke mobile cac/ke :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the kinetic energy of a group of
atoms/elements by using their velocities and nodal velocities.
The kinetic energy of a finite element is estimated using the average
(with respect to node count) of the nodal velocities squared multiplied
by the element scales.

The number of atoms/elements contributing to the kinetic energy is assumed to be
constant for the duration of the run; use the {dynamic} option of the
"compute_modify"_compute_modify.html command if this is not the case.

:line

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global scalar (the kinetic energy).
This value can be used by any command that uses a global scalar 
as input. See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for
an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The scalar value calculated by this compute is "intensive".
The scalar value will be in energy "units"_units.html.  

[Restrictions:] 

This compute requires a CAC atom style


[Default:] none
