dump cac/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID cac/atom N file args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms/elements to be dumped
cac/atom = style of dump command
N = dump every this many timesteps
file = name of file to write dump info to
args = charge :ul

[Examples:]

dump mesh all cac/atom 1000 CACmesh.txt
dump mesh all cac/atom 1000 CACmesh.txt charge :pre

[Description:]

Periodically outputs the tag, type, position, velocity, and force of a set of
virtual atoms and real atoms for the specified group. These virtual atoms are the
result of converting a CAC element into atomistic resolution through the interpolation fields.
The purpose of this is to print small regions of a CAC model that may require the use of
an atomistic diagnostic tool such as OVITO. The tag associated with virtual atoms is that
of the CAC element. The {charge} keyword can be used to output per atom charges for atom
styles that define charge.

IMPORTANT NOTE: CAC elements can be quite large, as a result a conversion to atomistic
resolution may result in a massive amount of data if your group size is not carefully
chosen. Currently you cannot elect to output a piece of a CAC element as virtual atoms,
if an element is included in the group (because its centroid is in the group region etc.)
then all of its material will be converted to virtual atoms and output.

NOTE: The "dump_modify sort"_dump_modify.html option
does not work with this dump style.
