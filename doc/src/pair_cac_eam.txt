pair_style cac/eam command :h3
pair_style cac/eam/alloy command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style style args :pre

style = {cac/eam} or {cac/eam/interp} or {cac/eam/alloy} or {cac/eam/alloy/interp}
args = list of arguments for a particular style :ul
  {cac/eam} args = quadrature_flag
    quadrature_flag = left blank or set to the {one} keyword :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style cac/eam
pair_coeff     * * Cu_u3.eam :pre

pair_style cac/eam/alloy
pair_coeff     * * CoAl.eam.alloy :pre

pair_style cac/eam one
pair_coeff     * * Cu_u3.eam :pre

pair_style cac/eam/interp
pair_coeff     * * Cu_u3.eam :pre

[Description:]

The {cac/eam} style computes pairwise forces using
the Embedded-Atom-Method (EAM) potential for a CAC model. Other than the allotment
of the {one} keyword, the rest of the input parameters and pair_coeff settings
are as found in "pair_style eam"_pair_eam.html. For more information on
the quadrature scheme and the effect of the {one} keyword see "Howto CAC"_Howto_cac.html
for the details.

:line

Style {cac/eam/alloy} computes pairwise interactions using the same
formula as style {cac/eam} for a CAC model.  However the associated
"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command reads a DYNAMO {setfl} file
instead of a {funcfl} file.  {Setfl} files can be used to model a
single-element or alloy system. See "pair_style eam"_pair_eam.html for
more information.

:line

The {cac/eam/interp} style computes pairwise forces using the Embedded-Atom-Method (EAM)
potential for a CAC model. The distinction between this style and the {cac/eam} style
is the use of finite element interpolation to compute electron densities.
As a result the potential calculation is substantially faster than that
performed in {cac/eam} at a cost to the accuracy.

NOTE: CAC Pair Styles do not currently support being substyles of pair_style
hybrid

NOTE: this pair style does not require the MANYBODY package to be installed.

[Restrictions:]

CAC Pair styles require the definition of a CAC atom style.
