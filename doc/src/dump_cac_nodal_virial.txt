dump cac/nodal/virial command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID cac/nodal/virial N file args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms/elements to be dumped
cac/nodal/virial = style of dump command (other styles {atom} or {cfg} or {dcd} or {xtc} or {xyz} or {local} or {custom} are discussed on the "dump"_dump.html doc page)
N = dump every this many timesteps
file = name of file to write dump info to
args = same as arguments for "dump_style custom"_dump.html :ul

[Examples:]

dump mesh all cac/nodal/virial 1000 CACmesh.txt :pre

[Description:]

Periodically outputs the equivalent nodal values of the virial stress. The nodal virial
of all finite elements for each of their respective internal degrees of freedom will be 
printed; atom positions will also be printed and denoted by the 0 element type following
one line of position data.

NOTE: The element header for each atom or finite element possesses three additional
dummy zeroes after the element scales due to implementation constraints. Make sure
to read these in first in any post-processing script to avoid erroneous nodal info.
The six vector of stress components is output in the following order: xx, yy, zz,
xy, xz, yz

NOTE: The "dump_modify sort"_dump_modify.html option
does not work with this dump style.
