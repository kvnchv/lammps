/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Invalid atom_style cac/charge command

Check the documentation for the correct arguments to the cac/charge atom style.

E: Per-processor system is too big

The number of owned atoms plus ghost atoms on a single
processor must fit in 32-bit integer.

E: cac atom styles require a CAC comm style

Self-explanatory

E: poly count declared in data file was greater than maxpoly in input file

One of the input poly counts for an element in the data file was greater than
the maximum declared poly count that was passed as an arg to the atom style
cac invocation. Increase the argument value to be greater than any poly
count in your input file.

E: element type not yet defined, add definition in process_args function of atom_vec_CAC.cpp style

Self-explanatory. Contact author for detailed advice if encountering issues defining a new element type.

E: element type requires a greater number of nodes than the specified maximum nodes per element passed to atom style cac

One of the input element types in your data file requires more nodes than the maximum you specified as an
arg to the atom style cac command.

E: Invalid node index in CAC_Elements section of data file

A node index supplied as part of a CAC element's definition is not within the range of possible 
node indices (1-element_node_count) for this element type

E: Invalid poly index in CAC_Elements section of data file

A poly index supplied as part of a CAC element's definition is not within the range of possible 
poly indices (1-poly_count) for the poly_count declared in the element's header line

E: Invalid atom type in CAC_Elements section of data file

Atom types must range from 1 to specified # of types.

E: more than one type assigned to the same poly index in an element

The poly index represents an internal variable of the underlying crystal structure approximated 
by the given finite element. Since each such internal variable essentially represents a particle 
spanning a deforming lattice it is not correct to associate two different mass types to one poly index.

E: there are more nodes for one internal DOF than the element type admits

one of the poly indices has too many nodes associated with it in the declaration of 
element data. Make sure that the total number of line entries after your element
header is element_node_count*poly_count and that each poly index appears element_node_count
times.

E: cac atom style does not yet support writing data files

Self-explanatory
